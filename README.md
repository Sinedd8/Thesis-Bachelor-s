🧠 Abstract

Designed a data-driven, policy-oriented recommendation framework to optimize crop selection for degraded soils in the Global South. While the subject was sustainable farming (cover cropping, intercropping, no-till), the core contribution lies in structuring an actionable policy tool: a multi-criteria decision model with a geospatial lens. The framework balances agronomic traits with socioeconomic constraints like machinery dependence, water needs, and local adaptability.

⚙️ Methods & Tools

Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis
Created a scoring framework based on 8 factors: cover crop suitability, intercrop compatibility, no-till adaptability, water needs, hardiness, allelopathy, machinery needs, and labor complexity.

Monte Carlo Simulation
Performed 10,000 iterations of ±50% weight perturbation to test model robustness.

Geospatial Matching
Mapped environmental zones (rainfall, soil type, water availability) and matched optimal crops accordingly using datasets + visual overlays.

Policy Positioning
Highlighted systemic barriers such as seed access, local legislation, subsidy gaps, and recommended pathways for policy adoption.

📊 Key Outputs

A shortlist of 10 high-performing, zone-specific crop species.

A scalable model to guide ecological policy in agriculture.

Framework can be integrated into public policy tools for land-use planning or government crop subsidies.

🧩 Your Role

"I developed the entire analytical framework from scratch: multi-criteria scoring, robustness validation, and geospatial recommendation system. My focus was on creating a policy-friendly tool, not just academic output. The emphasis was on approach, not domain."
